Spring
-----
earlier we used to have legacy frameworks like EJB,JSF,Struts

Spring i sone of the lightweight framework in 2003 by Rod Johnson

Spring is an open source application framework which is used to develop Java EE applications.Using simple Java POJO's u can create high performing applications,VMware along iwth 
pivotal software developed this 

Why spring
-------
Java complex programs and featurs with heavyweight components that are dependent on OS then we should have some framework which is secure ,light weight and efficient


How Spring works:(Spring MVC framework)
------
A web application is a layered architecture that has three layers

1.Presentation/View Layer - UI ,Interaction with user
2.Business logic layer - logic of the pgm
3.Data Access layer - data retrieval from source system(datbases)

M- Model
V -View
C - Controller

Important terms of Spring
-------
1.@Component - Spring knows how to manage ,it will auto identify for dependency injection (Instatiate the object)
2.@autowired - ho wto handle the object instatiation (loose coupling)
loose coupling - one component is not tightly coupled with other components 
Eg : view is implemented in htm and business logic layer and dao layer is implemented in java
so in future if we want to move that to react instead of html we can esaily do that without changing business logic layer and dao layer

3.@bean - backbone of the application.An object is created uisng spring bean that creation,instanciation is managed by the IOC (Inversion Of Control) application

4.Dependecny Injection - we can easily change without affecting the other applications
1.Setter based dependency injection
2.constructor based dependency injection

5.Inversion of control- taking contraol away from java class and giving it to spring framework 
1.ApplicationContext
2.BeanFcatory
